        <h1>Healthy Pizza</h1>
        <img src="../images/pizza.jpg" alt="A delicous healthy pizza">
        <p>Pizzas are one of my favorite meals, and I know is in your top 5! It is very hard to find a healthy version of this delicious dish, <br> so I encourage you to do by yourself at home.</p>
        <p>I know you might think I don't have much time to do pizza dough, and that's why I made this alternative recipe that you will be <br> able to do it in less than 30 minutes!! </p>
        <p>To make a pizza healthy there are four main points to keep in main that would make a huge difference.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Homemade thin crust: This is a key element will reduce significantly the amount of calories per porcion, and today I will <br>show how to make it.</li>
            <li>Sauce: Use a simple homemade sauce, could pe a pesto sauce or a tomato sauce, which recipe you will find it <a href="tomatosauce.html">here</a>. </li>
            <li>Cheese: Use a limited amount of low fat cheese  like ricotta cheese, cottage cheese,goat cheese or -if you find- a light version <br> of mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li>Toppings: Add as many vegetable you want/can and try to avoid any processed food like pepperoni, ham, bacon and so.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Now that we have these main points in mind, let's cook our homemade pizza dough.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoon dry active yest </li>
            <li>1/2 cup warm watter</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon coconut sugar or honey</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cup old-fashioned oats</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon pink salt </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground garlic</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First, preheat your oven to 450°F or 230°C degrees.</li>
            <li>In a bowl whisk the yeast, water and sugar or honey. Let this set for a little while so yeast can develop, thi take about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the yeast is developing, put the oats in a blender or food processor and grind the heck out of them, to make oat flour.</li>
            <li>Reserve a 1/4 cup of the oat flour, put the remaining oat flour in a bowl with pink salt and mix.</li>
            <li>Add the yeast mixture, oil and garlic and mix everything by hand.</li>
            <li>Divide into two even dough balls; knead each until smooth (alternatively, you can freeze one dough ball).</li>
            <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll out each dough ball into a 1/4-inch thick circle.</li>
            <li>Place it in non-stick pan or one coated with cooking spray. Shape the edges of dough by pressing against your hand. The edges need <br> to be relatively smooth.</li>
            <li>Now it is time to bake the crust for 7-8 minutes. Meanwhile, you can make the sauce and prepare the toppings!</li>
            <li>Remove the crust carefully from the oven and add the sauce, cheese and your favorites toppings.</li>
            <li>Finally, bake for 9-10 more minutes or ultil crust is gold brown and good appetite!</li>
        </ol>
        <P>And that's it! See?  I told you making your own pizza crust wasn’t difficult and won't take much time!</P>
