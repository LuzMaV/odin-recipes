        <p> And I'm sure these pancakes will become your favorites, so I won't miss more time talking / writing and let's cook!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup oats</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 measure powdered stevia </li>
            <li>1/4 cup shredded carrot </li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1/4 cup unsweetened almond milk or water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>coconut or canola oil for cooking</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Put all ingredients (beside carrots) to a blender and blend on high for 30 seconds or until completely smooth.</li>
            <li>Add the carrots, stir (DO NOT BLEND) everything with a spoon and set batter aside to rest for 5 minutes. </li>
            <li>Heat a light coat of coconut or canola oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Stir the batter again with the spoon and drop 2 tablespoons of the batter for each pancake into the skillet. <br> Depending of the size of your skillet you can put 3 or 4 pancakes at the same time. </li>
            <li>Cook until panckes slightly puff up and you see a few bubbles along the edges, 2-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Flip pancakes until golden brown on underside. If you find that pancakes are browning too quickly, <br>then you need to lower the heat.</li>
            <li>Once they are cooked, put pancakes in a plate with a cloth or absorbent paper. </li>
            <li>Repeat with more oil and remaining batter. Makes 5 to 6 pancakes total.</li>
            <li>Now its time to serve them with your favorites toppings like blueberrys, greek yogurt or sugar free syrop!</li>
        </ol>
