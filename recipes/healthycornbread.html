        <h1>Healthy Cornbread</h1>
        <img src="../images/cornbread.JPG" alt="Healthy cornbread stuffed with avocado and boiled egg.">
        <p>This a different cornbread as you might know until now, this bread is salty and the consistency is between an arepa and a cornbread.<br>At least, I made this recipe one day per week.</p>
        <p>No need for oil, sugar or oven in this recipe! You just need a pan and healthy but delicious fillings for your cornbread!</p>
        <p>Let's cook!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 1/2 tablespoon cornmeal</li>
            <li>4 tablespoon water (room temperature)</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>Salt, ground pepper and ground oregano to taste</li>
            <li>Coconut or canola oil for cooking</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, mix cornmeal, salt, ground pepper and ground oregano.</li>
            <li>Add egg, stir until well blended. </li>
            <li>Add water and mix until a homogeneous consistency is achieved.</li>
            <li>Heat a little bit of oil (I use coconut oil) in a non-stick frying pan.</li>
            <li>Put 2-3 tablespoon of mix (to make 2 small cornbreads) or all the mix (to make a 1 medium cornbread), cook for 10 minutes with<br> covered pan over medium low heat.</li>
            <li>Flip and cook for 5 more minutes with the pan covered.</li>
            <li>An this cornbread is ready to fill with whatever you want.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>My favortite fillers for this bread are avocado with boiled egg as you can see in the photo above. Other idea for filling is cottage cheese <br> with olives, it's just yummmmy!!!</p>
