Hi to everyone!
Here is my first HTML assignment by my own (and some of my notes hehe).
The assigment of the Odin Project is to build a basic recipe website
With this assigment I will refresh, put on practice and demostrate what I've learn about web development until today
- First, what I've learned about git comands ans github; after a little look at my notes I remember how to use them
- Second, What 've learned about how to create a website using only HTML (I have a fresh memor of that so I hope I will not check my notes hehe) 
So let's do this! and contunue learning. Hope you like this ;)
